## [![Hestia](src/banners/hestia_105x25.svg)](https://salsa.debian.org/chewkeanho-team/hestia) Libraries

[![Chew Kean Ho](src/icons/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

My super libraries focusing on providing highest consistencies across
multiple selected programming languages for stability and cross platform
usability. These libraries were written from scratch with 3 solid purposes:

1. Make sure cross-compilation across platforms and architectures can be done
   from anywhere to anywhere.
2. Make sure the algorithm is the same across multiple programming languages.
3. Make sure the libraries are decentralized, re-distributable, and its
   supply chain unaffected by geo-political shenanigans or a single business
   unit opression.

> **WHY HESTIA?**
>
> Like the mythology, I just want a peaceful library free from all the software
> industry's drama and friendly to others.
>
> We rarely heard about
> [Hestia (or Vesta)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestia) among the Olympus
> stories and dramas but she's there taking care everyone, steadily, and
> quietly. She is there making sure there's always a place to take rest and
> have warmth regardless who they are, what they are, or what they been through.

## Graphic & Media Design

[![Chew Kean Ho](src/icons/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

Here are some of my graphic & media projects using Open Source development
pipelines as the production backbones:

* **[Logo](https://salsa.debian.org/chewkeanho-team/Logo)** - My
  `Chew, Kean Ho` natural trademark branding & identity representation as a
  registered business person & as personal individual. It covers digital &
  web usages, motion media, all the way to monochrome stamping.
* **[Soundtracks](https://www.youtube.com/@chewkeanho-soundtracks)** - Musics
  developed for applications & leisure enjoyments.




## Legal & Licenses

[![Chew Kean Ho](src/icons/animated-banner_1200x100.svg)](#)

My legal documents and licenses deployed across all my ventures. These
documents are specifically architectured for continuous updates and upgrades
adapting to society changes. It is an in-depth research project from a lot of
open and closed source licenses designed for easy productization beyond software
products. It is constructed to suit both business and personal ventures.

Re-written from scratch, these documents use plain english for anyone to parse
easily without a specialized lawyer **(DISCLAIMER: I still high recommend you
get one. You cannot skip this)**.

> **WHY PREFIX MY NAME?**
>
> *For identification scoping and purposes only* - I can't claim the generic
> wording like `permissive` worldwide solely just for me. By prefixing, I scope
> them down to **my version** of permissive. It makes the communication crips
> and clear.
